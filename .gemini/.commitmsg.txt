üêõ fix: UnoCSS styling not applying to Svelte components

Resolved an issue where UnoCSS utility classes were not being applied to Svelte components.
The problem was due to UnoCSS not explicitly scanning Svelte files.

Solution:
- Added `content.pipeline.include` configuration to `astro.config.mjs` to ensure UnoCSS scans Svelte files.
- This allows dynamic class names generated by `cva` within Svelte components to be correctly processed by UnoCSS.
